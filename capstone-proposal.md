Project's Purpose or Goal: primary for the vision-impaired, this project will provide detailed visual descriptions of things such as landmarks, buildings, famous people, animals, et cetera. Users can submit requests and other users can submit descriptions which other users can then rate.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: User sign in/registration/authentication, feature to submit requests, admin approve request and publish to queue, other users can submit descriptions and then those can get approved and published to site. Must be accessible to vision-impaired.

Tools: Ruby on Rails with partial or full React frontend. Database with Postgres. Devise gem for user. Webpacker gem (react). Axios for API use in react. Potentially Serializer? 

Stretch Goals: Make UI really nice. Banning/reporting feature. Setup email host so people can reach out. Image upload or voice recording upload instead of text-based request/description. User profile with nice styling, flesh out setting. User can upload a photo as avatar if they want. Anyone can rate published descriptions.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require? Unsure!
